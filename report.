# Social Influences on World Happiness

## Background

This dataset derived from the Gallup's World Poll showcases data measured from an average of a survey asking participants to rate their happiness on a scale. Using this scale we are able to compare and contrast how on average a citizen is able to base their happiness, whether it be how the economy is thriving, how corrupt their country is, or their personal liberties.

## Data Dictionary
